# Federated Learning with XGBoost and Flower

This project contains the necessary files to run Flower and WandB.ai for XGBoost.
The project structure is as follows:

```shell
FL_XGBoost
├── FL_XGBoost
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── client_app.py 
│   ├── server_app.py 
│   └── task.py 
├── pyproject.toml 
└── README.md
```

Each code file contains not only the code for the default run (5 clients), but also the versions for 50 and 200 clients.
However, these versions are commented out.

The most important packages to get this running can be found in requirements_annina.txt

Have fun! :D
